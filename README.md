### PROJECT TITLE:"Revving Efficiency: SQL-Powered Database Design for Streamlined Operations in a Car Dealership"
Welcome to my personal project.

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict and understand students' academic performance based on demographic and mental health information.

### Problem Statement
Inefficient Data Management: The current manual and disjointed data handling processes at a car dealership hinder operational efficiency, leading to delays, errors, and missed opportunities. 
### Solution
There is a critical need for a well-structured SQL-powered database system to centralize, organize, and optimize our data management, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes, customer interactions, and overall business performance."
